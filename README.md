# Disfida

(NOTE THAT THE GUI VERSION MAY HAVE IMAGES WHICH ARE COPYRIGHTED. CLEARLY THESE ARE ONLY MEANT AS PLACEHOLDERS FOR PERSONAL USE, NOT FOR A SALEABLE VERSION OF THE GAME.)

A strategic two-player card combat game built with the 40-card Italian/Neapolitan deck (but easily adapted to French cards with spades (spade), hearts (coppe), clubs (bastoni), and diamonds (denari)). Inspired by traditional Italian card games but reimagined as a tactical duel where players use **characters**, **suit specials**, and **combos** to outmaneuver their opponent and reduce their health to zero.


## üéÆ Game Overview

**Disfida** transforms the classic Italian 40-card deck into a battle of wits and strategy. Each player commands a **character** (Fante/Page, Cavallo/Knight, or Re/King) of one suit, wielding unique bonuses and suit-specific abilities. The goal? Reduce your opponent's health from 40 to 0 while protecting your own.

### Core Mechanics
- **40-card Italian deck**: 4 suits (Coins, Cups, Swords, Clubs) √ó 10 ranks (A=11, 2-7, 3 face cards)
- **Character bonuses**: Kings bolster shields, Knights enhance attacks, Pages amplify healing
- **Suit specials**: Coins offer more cards, Swords sacrifice health for power, Cups share blessings, Clubs adapt to any role
- **Combo system**: Play sequences of your character's suit + 1 wildcard card
- **Shield mechanics**: Visible defense cards that persist until destroyed, then cycle back to your deck
- **Mechanics still under development**: In the current description the game can be a little slow. I will probably add more combo possibilities.

### Win Condition
Reduce your opponent's health to ‚â§0. If both players reach 0 simultaneously, it's a **tie**!

## üéØ How to Play

### Setup
1. **Character Assignment**: Each player receives a unique face card (Fante, Cavallo, or Re) of one suit
2. **Deck Building**: 
   - Standard characters: 12-card stack, 4-card starting hand
   - Coins character: 13-card stack, 5-card starting hand (Wealth of Choice)
3. **Pre-game**: Players may play one shield (Coins or Clubs special) before normal play begins
4. **Starting Health**: Both players begin at 40 HP (capped at 40)

### Turn Structure
1. **Play Phase**: 
   - Skip your turn
   - Play one card (normal or special)
   - Play a combo (sequence of your character's suit + optional 1 non-suit card)
2. **Resolution**: Cards resolve in order (attacks vs shields, heals restore HP, shields add defense)
3. **Draw Phase**: Refill hand to starting size (4 or 5 cards)

### Card Roles & Values
| Suit | Base Role | Value |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Coins (Denari)** | Shield (defense) | A=11, 2-7 |
| **Cups (Coppe)** | Heal (restore HP) | A=11, 2-7 |
| **Swords (Spade)** | Attack (damage) | A=11, 2-7 |
| **Clubs (Bastoni)** | Attack (damage) | A=11, 2-7 |

### Character Bonuses
| Character | Bonus |
|-----------|-------|
| **Re (King)** | +2 defense per shield card in play |
| **Cavallo (Knight)** | +1 attack per attack card played |
| **Fante (Page)** | +2 healing per healing card played |

### Suit Specials
| Suit | Special | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Coins** | **Wealth of Choice** | +1 card in stack and hand (passive) |
| **Swords** | **Blood Price** | Use Cups as attacks (ignore shields(?), take floor(value/2) self-damage) |
| **Cups** | **Charity's Burden** | Use Swords as healing (opponent also gains floor(value/2) HP) |
| **Clubs** | **Iron Versatility** | Clubs can be used as attack OR shield (choice at play) |

## üõ°Ô∏è Shield Mechanics

Shields are **visible cards on the table** that provide persistent defense:

1. **Playing Shields**: Coins cards or Clubs (with special for Clubs Heroes) add defense during your turn
2. **Attack Resolution**: When attacked, shields are destroyed from **smallest to largest** until cumulative defense ‚â• attack value
3. **Destruction**: Destroyed shields cycle to the bottom of your deck (not discarded)
4. **Character Bonus**: King's +2 defense applies to each active shield dynamically

**Example**: King with shields 3 coins (diamonds) and 7 coins (diamonds) has effective defense of 5 and 9 respectively.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Combat Resolution

### Attack vs Shields
```
Attack Value: 8 (7‚ô† +1 Knight bonus)
vs Shields: 3‚ô¢ (3+2=5), 7‚ô¢ (7+2=9)

Step 1: 8 - 5 = 3 remaining
Step 2: 3 - 9 = -6 (success!)
Result: Attack fully blocked, both shields destroyed and cycled
```
Another example, both Heroes being Fante/Pages, and therefor no bonuses for attack or defense:

```
Attack Value: 2‚ô†
vs Shields: 3‚ô¢, 7‚ô¢

Step 1: 2 - 3 = -1 (successfully blocked by smallest shield)

Result: Attack fully blocked, 3‚ô¢ destroyed and cycled, 7‚ô¢ undamaged and remains
```
